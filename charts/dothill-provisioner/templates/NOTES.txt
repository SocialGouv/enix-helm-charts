Thank you for using Dothill provisioner. It will be soon up and running.

In order to dynamically provide a persistant volume, you have to create a storage class first. Please refer to the README to do so. (https://github.com/enix/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/dothill-provisioner/README.md#creating-a-storage-class)
