{{ template "chart.description" . }}

Currently, it will only target files and directories on cluster nodes using
`hostPath`.

## TL;DR;

For a typical kubeadm deployed cluster with prometheus-operator :

```
$ cat values.yaml
exporter:
  watchFiles:
    - /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
  watchDirectories:
    - /etc/kubernetes/pki/
    - /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/
  watchKubeconfFiles:
    - /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    - /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
prometheusServiceMonitor:
  create: true
prometheusRules:
  create: true
tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    operator: Exists

$ helm repo add enix https://charts.enix.io
$ helm install my-release enix/x509-exporter -f values.yaml
```

{{ template "chart.sourceLinkLine" . }}

{{ template "chart.requirementsSection" . }}

## Installing the Chart

You'll have to define values as the exporter won't provide any metric when
using defaults.
A good starting point is to identify paths for cluster certificates in your
Kubernetes distribution. Expiration of cluster certificates can cause
significant outages so you'd want to alerted if renewal is required.

On a kubeadm deployed cluster, we'd want to watch kubelet certificates as
well as the PKI directory. If your Kubeconfig files also contain embedded
certificates, it can be passed to the exporter too. Adapt the following to your
Kubernetes deployment :
```yaml
exporter:
  watchFiles:
    - /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
  watchDirectories:
    - /etc/kubernetes/pki/
    - /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/
  watchKubeconfFiles:
    - /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    - /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

**Note :** because all nodes may not hold the same sets of certificate
files, it is recommended to install as many releases of this chart as
you have node kinds. That way each one gets a targetted configuration,
the exporter won't try openning missing files or kubernetes mount
empty directories.

When watching cluster certificates, you would also want the x509-exporter
DaemonSet to be running on master nodes and other control-plane nodes.
Tolerations have to be set for the NoSchedule effect. Again, on a kubeadm
cluster you could use :
```yaml
tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    operator: Exists
```
Other distributions such as Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) may require
additionnal tolerations for master nodes :
```yaml
tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    operator: Exists
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane
    operator: Exists
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd
    operator: Exists
```

For prometheus-operator users, this Chart can install a `ServiceMonitor` and
a `PrometheusRules` ressources to have the x509-exporter service auto-discovered
and Alertmanager notify on certificate expiry. Check the
[Chart Values](#chart-values) for options.

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```
$ helm install my-release enix/x509-exporter -f values.yaml
```

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and
deletes the release.
